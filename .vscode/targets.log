May not be used with -run-tests-until-failure.
    -run-tests-until-failure                                 If specified, tests will run until they fail. May be used in conjunction with -test-iterations <number>, in which case <number> will be the maximum number of iterations. Otherwise, a maximum of 100 is assumed. May not be used with -retry-tests-on-failure.
    -test-repetition-relaunch-enabled YES|NO                 Enable or disable, tests repeating in a new process for each repetition.  Must be used in conjunction with -test-iterations, -retry-tests-on-failure, or -run-tests-until-failure. If not specified, tests will repeat in the same process.
    -only-test-configuration                                 constrains testing by specifying test configurations to include, and excluding other test configurations
    -skip-test-configuration                                 constrains testing by specifying test configurations to exclude, but including other test configurations
    -testLanguage                                            constrains testing by specifying ISO 639-1 language in which to run the tests
    -testRegion                                              constrains testing by specifying ISO 3166-1 region in which to run the tests
    -resolvePackageDependencies                              resolves any Swift package dependencies referenced by the project or workspace
    -disableAutomaticPackageResolution                       prevents packages from automatically being resolved to versions other than those recorded in the `Package.resolved` file
    -onlyUsePackageVersionsFromResolvedFile                  prevents packages from automatically being resolved to versions other than those recorded in the `Package.resolved` file
    -skipPackageUpdates                                      Skip updating package dependencies from their remote
    -disablePackageRepositoryCache                           disable use of a local cache of remote package repositories
    -skipPackagePluginValidation                             Skip validation of package plugins (this can be a security risk if they are not from trusted sources)
    -packageCachePath                                        path of caches used for package support
    -json                                                    output as JSON (note: -json implies -quiet)
    -allowProvisioningUpdates                                Allow xcodebuild to communicate with the Apple Developer website. For automatically signed targets, xcodebuild will create and update profiles, app IDs, and certificates. For manually signed targets, xcodebuild will download missing or updated provisioning profiles. Requires a developer account to have been added in Xcode's Accounts preference pane or an App Store Connect authentication key to be specified via the -authenticationKeyPath, -authenticationKeyID, and -authenticationKeyIssuerID parameters.
    -allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration                     Allow xcodebuild to register your destination device on the developer portal if necessary. This flag only takes effect if -allowProvisioningUpdates is also passed.
    -authenticationKeyPath                                   specifies the path to an authentication key issued by App Store Connect. If specified, xcodebuild will authenticate with the Apple Developer website using this credential. The -authenticationKeyID and -authenticationKeyIssuerID parameters are required.
    -authenticationKeyID                                     specifies the key identifier associated with the App Store Conect authentication key at -authenticationKeyPath. This string can be located in the users and access details for your provider at "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com".
    -authenticationKeyIssuerID                               specifies the App Store Connect issuer identifier associated with the authentication key at -authenticationKeyPath. This string can be located in the users and access details for your provider at "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com".
    -scmProvider                                             which implementation to use for Git operations (system/xcode)
    -showBuildTimingSummary                                  display a report of the timings of all the commands invoked during the build
    -create-xcframework                                      create an xcframework from prebuilt libraries; -help for more information.

    -allowProvisioningUpdates                                Allow xcodebuild to communicate with the Apple Developer website.

    -authenticationKeyID                                     specifies the key identifier associated with the App Store Conect authentication key at -authenticationKeyPath. This string can be located in the users and access details for your provider at "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com".
    -authenticationKeyIssuerID                               specifies the App Store Connect issuer identifier associated with the authentication key at -authenticationKeyPath. This string can be located in the users and access details for your provider at "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com".
    -scmProvider                                             which implementation to use for Git operations (system/xcode)
