For manually signed targets, xcodebuild will download missing or updated provisioning profiles. Requires a developer account to have been added in Xcode's Accounts preference pane or an App Store Connect authentication key to be specified via the -authenticationKeyPath, -authenticationKeyID, and -authenticationKeyIssuerID parameters.
    -allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration                     Allow xcodebuild to register your destination device on the developer portal if necessary. This flag only takes effect if -allowProvisioningUpdates is also passed.
    -authenticationKeyPath                                   specifies the path to an authentication key issued by App Store Connect. If specified, xcodebuild will authenticate with the Apple Developer website using this credential. The -authenticationKeyID and -authenticationKeyIssuerID parameters are required.
    -authenticationKeyID                                     specifies the key identifier associated with the App Store Conect authentication key at -authenticationKeyPath. This string can be located in the users and access details for your provider at "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com".
    -authenticationKeyIssuerID                               specifies the App Store Connect issuer identifier associated with the authentication key at -authenticationKeyPath. This string can be located in the users and access details for your provider at "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com".
    -scmProvider                                             which implementation to use for Git operations (system/xcode)
    -showBuildTimingSummary                                  display a report of the timings of all the commands invoked during the build
    -create-xcframework                                      create an xcframework from prebuilt libraries; -help for more information.
